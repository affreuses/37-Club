# 37 Club 🚙

- The 37 Club keyboard is a handwired, 3D-printed, open-source keyboard.

- The goal of the keyboard is to make a very small keyboard with only the necessary keys for playing video games, while enjoying the beauty and comfort of a 40% keyboard.

- The keyboard is still a work in progress, so information is subject to change.

### Precaution ⚠️

I can't guarantee that the 3D models will work
I'm still in the keyboard design phase.

# To-Do List 📌

- Actually build the handwired keyboard ( I still haven't build it... )
- Improve the case, because it’s too simple
- Create a PCB
- Make a build guide
- Organize a mini group buy
- Create a mini keychain version of the keyboard
